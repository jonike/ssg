NOTE: this is unsupported, once upon a time, this worked to build a static library using Visual C++ for ssg.
Haven't tested lately, its probably quite broken!
Options:
On Windows, use the projects/instructions in ../ssg-lib-codeblocks (for codeblocks only!)
On mac or linux, just cd to the top of the ssg tree and type "make".
